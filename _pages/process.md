# Agile development process

#### Cubicflow develops using an agile methodology. This&nbsp;approach allows us to respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences and empirical&nbsp;feedback. Agile&nbsp;means you have a project running sooner - with&nbsp;regular updates being delivered during the course of&nbsp;development.

With some projects there is not always a clear definition where one milestone ends and another begins -- agile development is the solution to this problem. An in-depth Discovery phase helps us to identify challenges early in development. In addition, Discovery is a time for us to orientate ourselves to both the brand and the user-experience&nbsp;goals.

Our process gives us the ability to iterate through a number of ideas before honing in on a particular set of solutions. We use this '10x' phase to explore diverse concepts, perspectives, and ultimately design solutions. Focusing on the strongest answers also helps us more clearly define the Minimal&nbsp;Viable&nbsp;Product.

Finally, quality control plays a continuous and important role -- ultimately ramping up as preparations are made to deploy and&nbsp;go-live.
