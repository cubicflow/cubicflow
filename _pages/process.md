# Agile development process

#### Cubicflow develops using the Agile methodology. This approach allows us to respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences and empirical feedback. Agile means you have an app, website, or other project running sooner - with regular updates being delivered during the course of&nbsp;development.

In the Agile process there is not always a clear definition of where one milestone ends and another begins. Projects requiring a defined scope will usually begin with an in-depth Discovery phase that helps us to identify problems and objectives early on in development. In addition, Discovery is a time for us to immerse ourselves in the brand and user-experience&nbsp;goals.

With agile you can iterate through a number of ideas and concepts, before honing in on a particular solution or tech stack. We use this '10x' phase to explore an array of diverse ideas, perspectives, and design solutions. Focusing on the strongest answers helps define the project's Minimal&nbsp;Viable&nbsp;Product.

Quality control plays a continuous and important role - ultimately ramping up as preparations are made to deploy and&nbsp;go-live.
