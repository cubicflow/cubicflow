  <h1>The Challenge</h1>

  <p>Truck Adventures wanted to up their game big-time to celebrate their 2nd annual event. They knew that growing exposure, building a brand, and really solidifying their web presence would all be key to increasing ticket sales. Our combined efforts led to an increase in over 400% in ticket sales with&nbsp;soaring&nbsp;conversion&nbsp;rates.</p>

  <h1>How Cubicflow Helped</h1>
  <p>We created a refreshed corporate identity and logomark - along with a series of fun illustrations - to launch alongside their completely new website and e-commerce ticketing system. We then turned to targeted social media campaigns that funneled people into the site for more info or&nbsp;to&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;tickets.</p>
