  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>Life&nbsp;Flower&nbsp;Care, a boutique Californian cosmetics line, required a brand and artwork to promote their product. Playing in a crowded and diverse market, Life&nbsp;Flower's identity would therefore need to center around the ethos of their business and offerings, their story told in a clear and&nbsp;no-nonsense&nbsp;way.</p>

  <h1>How Cubicflow Helped</h1>
  <p>In the case of Life&nbsp;Flower, the brand began with the story the logo tells. When working with the packaging and artwork, the designs always place the product first. A minimalist and natural approach is taken with everything to build the trust of the user. Extra considerations were made, including: the use of post-recycled material, solutions such as amber glass to increase the product's shelf life, and reducing the amount of packging to&nbsp;produce&nbsp;less&nbsp;waste.</p>

    <div class="casestudy__testimonial__quote">“Once I actually got the opportunity to work with Cubicflow on a project, I started to understand what set them apart from other companies that I had used...it was their process. They are talented artists, branding experts, UI designers for sure...but their process is what makes them truly unique, and is what makes their resulting product truly different from other companies. You have to experience it for yourself to understand... but&nbsp;you&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;disappointed.”</div>
