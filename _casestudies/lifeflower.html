  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>Harlowe's - a boutique restaurant located in historic Old Pasadena, CA - first approached us early in their business planning to work on the design concept. The Neue Deco-inspired concept that followed helped close a deal, start a new business, and Cubicflow has since worked on the Harlowe's brand identity, web design, and&nbsp;much&nbsp;more.</p>

  <h1>How Cubicflow Helped</h1>
  <p>Harlowe's got our full-service treatment. Logo design and branding, print collateral, completely responsive custom web site, and more. Collaboration played a vital role in creating a brand where none existed before. Every detail was considered -- when the Harlowe's team painstakingly restored the building's original wood interior, we partnered with a local and classically-trained sign painter to bring to life the signage and gold leaf window&nbsp;designs.</p>

    <div class="casestudy__testimonial__quote">“Once I actually got the opportunity to work with Cubicflow on a project, I started to understand what set them apart from other companies that I had used...it was their process. They are talented artists, branding experts, UI designers for sure...but their process is what makes them truly unique, and is what makes their resulting product truly different from other companies. You have to experience it for yourself to understand... but&nbsp;you&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;disappointed.”</div>
