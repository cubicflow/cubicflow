  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>The Bottle Room serves up culinary flare and rare craft beers off the eclectic Greenleaf Avenue in Uptown Whittier. The Bottle Room is also an established and extremely well-liked business, so extra care was given to tackling their digital re-brand and new website, staying true to what makes The Bottle Room great while opening the doors to a new generation of&nbsp;customers.</p>

  <h1>How Cubicflow Helped</h1>
  <p>As part of The Bottle Room's rebrand we designed a new logo and typography system, various print collateral, package design and glasswear. We also built their new website and online menu system, while producing a ton of photography to showcase Chef Alcazar's delicious menu and craft-beer finds. Seasonally, we help The Bottle Room launch their new menu and the special events the restaurant&nbsp;hosts.</p>

    <div class="casestudy__testimonial__quote">“Once I actually got the opportunity to work with Cubicflow on a project, I started to understand what set them apart from other companies that I had used...it was their process. They are talented artists, branding experts, UI designers for sure...but their process is what makes them truly unique, and is what makes their resulting product truly different from other companies. You have to experience it for yourself to understand... but&nbsp;you&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;disappointed.”</div>
