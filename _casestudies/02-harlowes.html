  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>Located in historic Old Pasadena, CA, the handsome wood Art Deco interior of Harlowe’s French Dip surrounds and transports you back in time. Harlowe's first approached us early in their business planning to work on the design concept. After producing the initial Neue Deco-inspired concept -- used to secure the restaurant's investment -- Cubicflow worked on the entire brand identity, web design, and&nbsp;more for&nbsp;Harlowe's.</p>

  <h1>How Cubicflow Helped</h1>
  <p>Harlowe's got our full-service treatment. Logo design and branding, print collateral, completely responsive custom web site, and more. While the Harlowe's team painstakingly restored the original wood interior, we partnered with a local, classically-trained sign painter to bring to life the signage and gold leaf window designs.</p>

    <div class="casestudy__testimonial__quote">“Once I actually got the opportunity to work with Cubicflow on a project, I started to understand what set them apart from other companies that I had used...it was their process. They are talented artists, branding experts, UI designers for sure...but their process is what makes them truly unique, and is what makes their resulting product truly different from other companies. You have to experience it for yourself to understand... but&nbsp;you&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;disappointed.”</div>
