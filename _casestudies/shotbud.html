  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>The work we did with Shotbud leaned into our agile and integrated approaches to development and design. On one hand, our
  job was to help build a brand from the ground up, which required both a certain sensitivity and good listening skills. On
  the other hand, our development efforts were to not just build an iOS app or an Apple Watch app, but to create a harmonious
  user experience that is easy to use and takes advantage of the Apple&nbsp;Watch’s sensor&nbsp;capabilities.</p>

  <h1>How Cubicflow Helped</h1>
  <p> Working in any new product area presents a number of challenges and opportunities to create great design. The privilege
  to build the app as well as develop its communication meant every part could feel all the more familiar and immediately understandable
  to the user, key when you want to eliminate friction in technology. Shotbud arrives in the Apple App Store in&nbsp;early&nbsp;2018.</p>

    <div class="casestudy__testimonial__quote">“Once I actually got the opportunity to work with Cubicflow on a project, I started to understand what set them apart from other companies that I had used...it was their process. They are talented artists, branding experts, UI designers for sure...but their process is what makes them truly unique, and is what makes their resulting product truly different from other companies. You have to experience it for yourself to understand... but&nbsp;you&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;disappointed.”</div>
