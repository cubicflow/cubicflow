  <h1>The Challenge</h1>

  <p>Iconic Disc is an accessory designed to give your Mac an identity. It is a thin, magnetic frame that fits seamlessly over the glowing backlight of the Apple logo and holds an image printed on photo paper or a transparent film to illuminate it in a captivating glow. The company approached Cubicflow with the ultimate objective of funding their product through Kickstarter, and to develop their brand identity, web presence, and various collateral needed&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;campaign.</p>

  <h1>How Cubicflow Helped</h1>
  <p>We worked closely with the Iconic team to craft their brand and messaging from the very beginning. Cubicflow created the visual identity and logomark, as well as designed and developed the Iconic website. Our production included copywriting, photography, graphic design and 3D modeling services to bring it all together. The result was a successfully-funded Kickstarter campaign and a couple very happy&nbsp;new&nbsp;business&nbsp;owners.</p>
