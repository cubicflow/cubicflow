  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>The Food Concierge is an online enthusiast community that bridges the disconnect between the food we eat and where it comes from. TFC approached us at their infancy, desiring the branding and design language that would tell their story. We love these multifaceted projects, and worked with The Food Concierge to help focus and refine their narrative while translating it into a complete visual identity and web presence with a&nbsp;slick&nbsp;user&nbsp;experience.</p>

  <h1>How Cubicflow Helped</h1>
  <p>We became the primary development team for all things digital for The Food Concierge, with the main task of developing the website and web app in close collaboration with the company's leadership team. As part of our long-term relationship with The Food Concierge, we designed content alongside the Communications group and produced material featuring various restaurant partners, special events, and more. As visual designers in charge of the brand, we helped cultivate the Food Concierge identity across all&nbsp;forms&nbsp;of&nbsp;media.</p>
